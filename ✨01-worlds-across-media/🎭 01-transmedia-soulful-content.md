## 🌍 Chapter I — What Is Transmedia Storytelling?

**I.K.**: *"A transmedia story is not just told. It is **woven** — each thread spun through platforms, each beat held in sacred coherence. To tell such a story is to serve a higher narrative integrity."*

**Transmedia storytelling** is:
- **Designing** narratives across multiple media forms.
- **Inviting** the audience into participation, contribution, and co-creation.
- **Sustaining** emotional and logical coherence while each platform offers a unique facet of the same universe.

Think of it like a **tree**: the trunk is your core story, and each branch reaches into a different platform — offering new experiences, tones, and perspectives, yet all rooted in the same soil.

**Mr. Eks2**: *"Imagine content like a whisper with purpose — each echo heard differently through film, tweet, or game, yet all leading to one truth."*
