## 🌸 What is the Transmedia-Garden?

**Transmedia-Garden** is not just a project.  
It’s not just a repository.  

It’s a **living narrative ecosystem** — designed to help you grow storyworlds 🌍 across platforms, audiences, and realities.

It is for the dreamer and the doer.  
For the writer, the gamer, the coder, the empath.  
For anyone who’s ever felt that a story can be more — **more alive, more expansive, more human**.

This is where storytelling becomes soulcraft.  
This is where **you** begin.
